# Rock-Paper-Scissors-

Learning Goals:

Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
+ DRY JavaScript
+ Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
+ Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
+ Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
+ Manipulate elements in the DOM
+ Practice understanding HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I worked with Atom, GitHub, local terminal, browser Dev Tools, and Procreate for graphics and gifs. 

Wins + Challenges:

WINS:

Finishing an application that meets the expectations and is visually appealing to me.
Being able to Google and learn new topics (CSS, HTML, JavaScript methods) and implement them.

CHALLENGES:

Breaking down the project into a plan/iterations. 
Attempting to adjust the application to be more user friendly.
